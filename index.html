    <h1>Ignite Healing AI</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">Emerging Research on AI, Regulation, and Human Capacity</div>

    <p>
      Ignite Healing AI is a research and innovation space exploring ethical,
      non-clinical uses of artificial intelligence to support nervous-system
      regulation, capacity awareness, and self-agency.
    </p>

    <p>
      This work is exploratory and research-oriented. It does not provide
      therapy, diagnosis, medical treatment, or crisis support.
    </p>

    <h2>What This Is</h2>

    <p>
      Ignite Healing AI serves as the conceptual and ethical incubator for
      emerging research at the intersection of AI, mental health, and human
      systems. The work focuses on understanding how patterns of overwhelm,
      shutdown, urgency, and capacity mismatch appear in everyday language,
      planning behavior, and self-reflection—and whether AI can safely support
      awareness of these patterns without directing behavior or replacing human
      care.
    </p>

    <p>
      The intent is not to automate mental-health support or replicate clinical
      practice. Instead, this research asks whether AI can function as a
      reflective mirror that helps individuals notice early signs of
      dysregulation and engage in self-directed, consent-based regulation
      practices.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Research Exists</h2>

    <p>
      Through more than two decades of leading complex systems, digital
      transformation, and organizational change, I observed a consistent
      pattern: many system failures are driven not by technical flaws, but by
      human overload, urgency cycles, and mismatches between expectations and
      capacity.
    </p>

    <p>
      People bring their nervous systems—and their lived histories—into every
      system they use. When capacity is exceeded, cognition narrows,
      communication breaks down, and even well-designed systems become
      difficult to use.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ignite Healing AI exists to explore whether AI can be designed to
      recognize these capacity-related patterns and offer gentle, non-coercive
      support that respects autonomy and limits—particularly for individuals
      who are underserved by traditional mental-health pathways.
    </p>

    <h2>Research Approach</h2>

    <p>
      This work uses practice-based, exploratory methods rather than formal
      clinical trials.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>reflective journaling and language observation</li>
      <li>qualitative pattern recognition in everyday planning and reflection</li>
      <li>applied systems analysis grounded in real-world workflows</li>
      <li>consent-based AI interaction design</li>
      <li>safety and harm-mitigation analysis</li>
      <li>explicit non-clinical scope and boundaries</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The emphasis is on learning, ethics, and design principles rather than
      outcomes or prescriptions.
    </p>

    <h2>Applied Frameworks Informing This Work</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Regulation-Centered System Design™ (RCSD™)</strong><br />
      A systems-thinking framework that treats nervous-system regulation as
      foundational to behavior, adoption, and decision-making. RCSD™ reframes
      resistance, burnout, and “failure” as capacity mismatches rather than
      motivation problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Systems in Serenity™</strong><br />
      A reflective model for understanding how safety, pacing, and clarity
      influence sustainable performance over time. It emphasizes reducing
      urgency-driven cycles in favor of steady, humane throughput.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Scrum for One™</strong><br />
      An adaptation of Agile and Scrum principles designed for individuals whose
      capacity fluctuates due to stress, trauma, neurodivergence, or caregiving
      demands. Scrum for One™ emphasizes micro-sprints, explicit capacity
      check-ins, consent-based prioritization, and retrospectives focused on
      regulation rather than productivity. The framework generates observable
      qualitative signals relevant to AI-supported pattern recognition.
    </p>

    <h2>Ethics and Boundaries</h2>

    <p>
      Ignite Healing AI does not diagnose, treat, or intervene in mental-health
      crises. It does not provide therapy, coaching, or clinical guidance. It
      does not replace professional care or human relationships.
    </p>

    <p>
      All research emphasizes autonomy, consent, transparency, and harm
      reduction. Any exploration of AI interaction prioritizes user agency,
      reversibility, and clear limitations.
    </p>

    <h2>About the Researcher</h2>

    <p>
      SK Lowther (they/them) is a Senior Project Manager, Business Systems
      Analyst, and Equity Facilitator with more than 20 years of experience
      leading complex systems and digital transformation across healthcare,
      government, nonprofit, and education sectors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Their professional background includes Agile and Scrum delivery, business
      and systems analysis, change leadership, and responsible technology
      adoption, alongside formal training in psychology, social work,
      embodiment, and nervous-system regulation. Ignite Healing AI represents
      their current focus as an independent, emerging researcher exploring how
      AI might support human capacity and regulation in ethical, non-clinical
      ways.
